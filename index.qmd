### Overview
This course will make you an expert at data I/O, transformation, programming, and visualization in R. 
We will use a consistent set of packages for these tasks called the `tidyverse`.

This is not a traditional programming or computer science course. 
It is meant to be an *applied* tour of how to actually use R for your data science needs. 
We also will not cover statistical analysis of data in this course, but the curriculum is a useful prerequisite for subsequent courses on statistics or machine learning.

This course is not graded, nor are there any assignments or homework. The lectures are just to get you started- they will be frequently interrupted by active learning exercises that you will be asked to complete in pairs or small groups. That's where the real learning will happen!

### Prerequisites
No prior experience with R is expected. Those with experience using R will still likely find much of value in this course since it covers a more modern style of R programming that has gained traction in the past decade.

We will use R through the RStudio interface. The easiest way to access RStudio is through the cloud: [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud). It's fast and easy- just go the link, click "get started" and create an account. Once you're in, click "new project" near the upper-right and the RStudio interface will open.

Alternatively, you can install R and RStudio on your own computer: 
[Follow this link](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and click on the appropriate options for your operating system to install R, 
then do the same to [install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).

### Learning Goals
By the end of the course, you will be able to:

* comfortably use R through the Rstudio interface
* read and write tabular data between R and flat files
* subset, transform, summarize, join, and plot data
* write reusable and readable programs
* seek out, learn, and integrate new packages and code into your analyses

### In-class Exercises
Programming, like all things, is something you learn by doing. The lectures include a lot of in-class group exercises so you can get your hands dirty. When we come upon one of these we will split the class into small groups of 3-4 students each (plus maybe a TA) and you will work together to solve the problem.

### Textbook
We will be using parts of the fantastic book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (R4DS:2e) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund (O'Reilly Media, 2017); it is online and also available in hardcopy.
